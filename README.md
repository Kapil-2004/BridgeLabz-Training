🚀 Day 1 – LeetCode Codebase (16 Dec)

On 16 December (Day 1), I kick-started my LeetCode problem-solving journey using Java.
I successfully solved 5 foundational interview-style problems, focusing on logic building and core data structures. All solutions are organized inside the leet-code-codebase folder.

📂 Problems Covered

Hello.java
✔️ A basic Hello World program to verify Java setup and execution.

AreaSquare.java
📐 Computes the area of a square using a given side length.

Palindrome.java
🔄 Validates whether a string is a palindrome, ignoring:

Non-alphanumeric characters

Letter casing
(Inspired by a classic LeetCode problem)

RemoveDuplicate.java
🧹 Removes duplicate integers from an array using a Set and returns unique values.

TwoSum.java
🎯 Solves the Two Sum problem efficiently using a HashMap to find indices whose values add up to a target.

📌 Summary

These programs represent my Day 1 progress toward mastering:

Java fundamentals

Problem-solving techniques

Common data structures used in technical interviews

📈 More challenges and optimized solutions coming soon!

🚀 Day 2 – Java Practice (17 Dec)

On 17 Dec (Day 2), I completed 10 practice questions in Java.
The implementations are currently stored as C# files in the programming-elements folder, but they reflect my Java problem-solving practice.

AddTwoNumbers (AddTwo.java) – Reads two numbers and prints their sum.

AverageOfThree (AverageOfThree.java) – Reads three numbers and prints their average.

CelsiusToFahrenheit (CelsiusToFahrenheit.java) – Converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

CircleArea (CircleArea.java) – Calculates the area of a circle given its radius.

CylinderVolume (CylinderVolume.java) – Calculates the volume of a cylinder from radius and height.

KilometreToMile (KilometreToMile.java) – Converts a distance from kilometres to miles.

PerimeterOfRectangle (PerimeterOfRectangle.java) – Calculates the perimeter of a rectangle from length and width.

PowerCalculation (PowerCalculation.java) – Raises a base number to a given exponent.

SimpleInterestCalculator (SimpleInterestCalculator.java) – Calculates simple interest from principal, rate, and time.

Welcome (Welcome.java) – Prints a welcome message to verify the environment setup.
