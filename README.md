🚀 Day 1 – LeetCode Codebase (16 Dec)

On 16 December (Day 1), I kick-started my LeetCode problem-solving journey using Java.
I successfully solved 5 foundational interview-style problems, focusing on logic building and core data structures. All solutions are organized inside the leet-code-codebase folder.

📂 Problems Covered

Hello.java
✔️ A basic Hello World program to verify Java setup and execution.

AreaSquare.java
📐 Computes the area of a square using a given side length.

Palindrome.java
🔄 Validates whether a string is a palindrome, ignoring:

Non-alphanumeric characters

Letter casing
(Inspired by a classic LeetCode problem)

RemoveDuplicate.java
🧹 Removes duplicate integers from an array using a Set and returns unique values.

TwoSum.java
🎯 Solves the Two Sum problem efficiently using a HashMap to find indices whose values add up to a target.

📌 Summary

These programs represent my Day 1 progress toward mastering:

Java fundamentals

Problem-solving techniques

Common data structures used in technical interviews

📈 More challenges and optimized solutions coming soon!
